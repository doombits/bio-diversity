    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Biodiversity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic Diversity:</strong> The variety of genes within a species.</li>
            <li><strong>Species Diversity:</strong> The variety of species in a particular region or ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecosystem Diversity:</strong> The variety of ecosystems, such as forests, deserts, wetlands, and coral reefs.</li>

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>
            Various conservation efforts are being implemented to protect biodiversity, including the establishment of protected areas, sustainable land management practices, reforestation, and legislation aimed at preserving endangered species and habitats.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Strategies">
        <h2>Strategies for Biodiversity Conservation</h2>
        <p>Following are the important strategies for biodiversity conservation:

            All the varieties of food, timber plants, livestock, microbes and agricultural animals should be conserved.
            All the economically important organisms should be identified and conserved.
            Unique ecosystems should be preserved first.
            The resources should be utilized efficiently.
            Poaching and hunting of wild animals should be prevented.
            The reserves and protected areas should be developed carefully.
            The levels of pollutants should be reduced in the environment.
            Deforestation should be strictly prohibited.
            Environmental laws should be followed strictly.
            The useful and endangered species of plants and animals should be conserved in their nature as well as artificial habitats.
            Public awareness should be created regarding biodiversity conservation and its importance.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Strategies">
        <h2>In-situ Conservation</h2>
        <p>In-situ conservation of biodiversity is the conservation of species within their natural habitat. In this method, the natural ecosystem is maintained and protected.

            The in-situ conservation has several advantages. Following are the important advantages of in-situ conservation:
            
            It is a cost-effective and convenient method of conserving biodiversity.
            A large number of living organisms can be conserved simultaneously.
            Since the organisms are in a natural ecosystem, they can evolve better and can easily adjust to different environmental conditions.
            Certain protected areas where in-situ conservation takes place include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves.

    <section id="Strategies">
        <h2>Ex-situ Conservation
        </h2>
        <p>Ex-situ conservation of biodiversity involves the breeding and maintenance of endangered species in artificial ecosystems such as zoos, nurseries, botanical gardens, gene banks, etc. There is less competition for food, water and space among the organisms.

            Ex-situ conservation has the following advantages:
            
            The animals are provided with a longer time and breeding activity.
            The species bred in captivity can be reintroduced in the wild.
            Genetic techniques can be used for the preservation of endangered species.

        <h2>Levels of Biodiversity
        </h2>
        <p>Ecosystem Diversity: A region may have one or several ecosystems. Examples of regions with low ecological diversity would be wide expanses of oceans or deserts. In accordance with this sense, a mountain area that has lakes, forests and grasslands would have higher biodiversity. A region that has several ecosystems may be able to provide more resources for the survival of native species, especially when an ecosystem is suffering from drought or disease.

            Functional Diversity: Functional diversity means a way of how species behave, obtain food and use the natural resources of an ecosystem. A species-rich ecosystem is assumed to have high functional diversity, because there exist many species with many different natures. A functional diversity of the ecosystem can be useful to ecologists who are trying to conserve or restore it, because with the known nature and roles of species, they can point to gaps in a food cycle or ecological niches which species lack.

        <h2>Importance of Biodiversity Conservation
        </h2>
        <p>Economic growth and poverty reduction: Biodiversity helps to derive food, construction material, fibre, firewood, industrial products, and medicinal value from natural environments that benefit humans. Researches prove that the majority of the world’s poor live in rural areas and depend upon wetlands, forests, pastures, and water for their livelihoods.

            Continuity of various ecosystems globally: Biodiversity plays an important role for rendering and protection of organisms in the ecosystem. Through biodiversity conservation, ecosystems like the coral reefs, tundra, rivers and streams, and grasslands can as well be supported and protected.
            
            Aesthetic value:: Ethics on environmental sustainability and conservation can be encouraged through biodiversity. Ecosystem’s right of an organism states that every form of life in any ecosystem is unique in its own way and deserves respect from human beings.</p>

        <h2>Biodiversity Conservation
        </h2>
        <p>conservation involves the protection, management, and restoration of biodiversity. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. Biodiversity can be conserved by various methods including in situ and ex situ conservation methods that include establishing national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, etc. Biodiversity should be conserved as it provides us with both economic and aesthetic benefits. In this article we will study the definition of biodiversity conservation, methods of conservation, and why it should be conserved.</p>

        <h2>National Parks
        </h2>
        <p>They are natural parks which are used with the objective of conservation and are preserved by the national government. Such regions are restricted from any human activities like poaching, grazing, cultivation, forestry, etc. Some of the national parks in India are Corbett National Park, Kaziranga National Park, and Gir National Park. These national parks help in ecological development by preserving natural resources and varied species.

        </p>

    <section id="Wildlife Sanctuaries">
        <h2>Wildlife Sanctuaries</h2>
        <p>These are the protected regions to preserve endangered wild animals. Some of the forbidden human activities in these areas are hunting, poaching or animal trapping. No particular boundaries or fencing are laid to restrict the movements of humans in the region and any entry for research or education purposes is allowed. Some of the wildlife sanctuaries are Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka, Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala, and Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka.

        <h2>Biosphere Reserves</h2>
        <p>These reserves, in addition to plant and animal conservation, restore the traditional life of human communities who are inhabited in the area. Some Biosphere Reserves are Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve in West Bengal, Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in Uttarakhand, and Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve in Great Nicobar. There are three different zones associated with Biosphere Reserves. These are:</p>

    <section id="Biodiversity Hotspots">
        <h2>Biodiversity Hotspots
        </h2>
        <p>A biodiversity hotspot are the areas of conservation where there is strictly a minimum of 1500 species of vascular plants and a habitat that has lost its 70% cover. These are protected areas for various purposes where the wildlife, inhabitant lifestyle, and domesticated plants and animals are conserved. Tourist and research activities are allowed.


            Example- The Himalayas, The Western Ghats, The North East, and The Nicobar Islands</p>

        <h2>Why should you conserve Biodiversity?
        </h2>

        <p>It is believed that an area with higher species abundance has a more stable environment compared to an area with lower species abundance. We can further claim the necessity of biodiversity by considering our degree of dependency on the environment. We depend directly on various species of plants for our various needs. Similarly, we depend on various species of animals and microbes for different reasons.

            Biodiversity is being lost due to the loss of habitat, over-exploitation of resources, climatic changes, pollution, invasive exotic species, diseases, hunting, etc. Since it provides us with several economic and ethical benefits and adds aesthetic value, it is very important to conserve biodiversity.
